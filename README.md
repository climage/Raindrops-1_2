**Algorithm (process) for raindrop game**


* Create a score variable
* Create an array of raindrops
* Create catcher
* One raindrop falls
* Make catcher follow mouse
* Check to see if the raindrop touches the catcher
* If the raindrop touches the catcher, score increases and raindrop disappears
* After a certain interval (based on when this raindrop fell), next raindrop falls
